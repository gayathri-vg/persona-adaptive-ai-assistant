# Persona-Adaptive AI Shopping Assistant

## Overview

This project implements a persona-adaptive AI shopping assistant using the Mistral-7B-Instruct model via the OpenRouter API. The system dynamically adjusts response style based on user type (Senior, Neurodivergent, Adult, Young, Family) to support accessible and inclusive AI interaction.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to explore human-centered AI system design through prompt conditioning. By modifying system-level instructions, the assistant adapts its communication style while maintaining task relevance.

## Features

- Dynamic system prompt conditioning  
- Persona-specific response adaptation  
- Modular Node.js implementation  
- Environment variable-based API key handling  
- Error handling and response logging  

## Tech Stack
